Using a [continuous integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
pipeline has become an increasingly standard practice at modern software
companies.

Let's look at how to set up a CI pipeline for open source software written in
[Go](http://golang.org).  All the services we will use are free (like beer) for
for use by Free (like Freedom) Software projects.


# Create a new project on Github

Start by creating a [new repository on Github](https://github.com/new), naming
it `foofinder`.


## Write a function

## Write a test for it.


# Set up Travis CI

## Why Travis rocks

## Why Travis sucks


# Set up Drone.io


# Set up Coveralls

## Add `goveralls` to Drone config.
